# aj-inventory. A NoPixel 3.0 Inspired Inventory. 

## Trbl .CSS Update:
Thanks for checking this edit out. 
We used this modified version of aj-inventory on our public server and now its available for you to try out yourself.
This is mostly the same as AJays December update with some additional code from snippets from the qbcore discord, 
like extra items with default uses (cigarette box) etc.
